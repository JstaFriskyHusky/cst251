	<h1>File Transfering</h1>
	<p>File transfering isn't as hard as it might sound, as it's just moving files
		from local to server. I had a couple of problems with the local image although
		it was easily fixed by moving the image into the folder. I have also found it
		possible to change \ into / which is supposed to work.<img src="https://c.tenor.com/bu5N5eskM9IAAAAC/doggo-big-iron.gif"

	<h2>Results</h2>
	<p>I got my website and my image properly working, with the code saying it
		came from my folder instead of a url.</p>
