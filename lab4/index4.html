	<h1>Jeffrey K Chen</h1>
	<p>Html is a lot easier than java, C++, C#, and python; although that's probably
	because they're coding and not mark up languages. Doesn't make it any less enjoyable though.
	</p>
	<p>The hardest part of learning this language would probably inputing images from a local
		 folder into the web. It took a while but I finally got it to work.</p>
