		 <h2>Challenge of this Lab</h2>
		 <p>The challenge with this lab is to create a form that is meant to train on how to use div correctly.
			 We also need to make a form utlizing inputs such as checkbox and radio.<p>
		 <h3>Problems I Encountered</h3>
		 <p>I had some problems with the radio type as I was unable to deselect an option when cicking on it.
			 It turned out that my name input wasn't the same and changing this made it work properly.<p>
		 <h4>Results</h4>
		 <p>I made a search form with a username, textbox, password, radio, checkbox, and submit button.<p>
