				<div class="stuff">
					<ol>
						<li>It took a while to center the main title but was alright.</li>
							<li>I couldn't really find any image close to the website without some stock watermark plastered all over the image.</li>
							<li>I was unable to lower the image for the menu icon as it seemed to be a bit higher than the words at all times.</li>
