	<h1>Stuff to Write</h1>
		<p><span>I am filling this with random information that maybe someone is willing to read. That's why I'm putting the most random stuff you can
			read. So how's life? I don't know, it's alright. I could be doing better but I'm not, but then again I wouldn't know if I was. So I just rewatched Spirited Away,
		  was pretty nice, I do question if the movers wonder where the family was. Did they just leave their luggage at the house or did they bring it back to wherever they kept it?
			Who knows. I do like those onigiris they eat though, it's just rice but sticky rice is good rice.</span><p>

		<h2>Problems I Had</h2>
			</div>
				<div class="stuff">
					<ol>
						<li>Had some problems with the aside tag text going out of border and off screen. I somehow fixed it but I have no clue how.
						I also had some problems with floating right, but this was due to having my position being absolute.</li>
							<li>Wasn't able to get my link to stay at the top with sticky. Was because my spelling was off like usual.</li>
						<ol>
