	<h1>BIG IRON</h1>

	<p>To the town of Agua Fria rode a stranger one fine day</p>
	<p>Hardly spoke to folks around him, didn't have too much to say</p>
	<p>No one dared to ask his business, no one dared to make a slip</p>
	<p>For the stranger there among them had a big iron on his hip</p>
  <p>Big iron on his hip</p>

	<p>It was early in the morning when he rode into the town</p>
  <p>He came riding from the south side slowly lookin' all around</p>
  <p>He's an outlaw loose and running, came the whisper from each lip</p>
  <p>And he's here to do some business with the big iron on his hip</p>
  <p>Big iron on his hip</p>

	<p>In this town there lived an outlaw by the name of Texas Red</p>
  <p>Many men had tried to take him and that many men were dead</p>
  <p>He was vicious and a killer though a youth of 24</p>
  <p>And the notches on his pistol numbered one and 19 more</p>
  <p>One and 19 more</p>

	<p>Now the stranger started talking, made it plain to folks around
  <p>Was an Arizona ranger, wouldn't be too long in town
  <p>He came here to take an outlaw back alive or maybe dead
  <p>And he said it didn't matter he was after Texas Red
  <p>After Texas Red</p>

	<p>Wasn't long before the story was relayed to Texas Red</p>
  <p>But the outlaw didn't worry men that tried before were dead</p>
  <p>20 men had tried to take him, 20 men had made a slip</p>
  <p>21 would be the ranger with the big iron on his hip</p>
  <p>Big iron on his hip</p>

	<p>The morning passed so quickly, it was time for them to meet</p>
	<p>It was 20 past 11 when they walked out in the street</p>
	<p>Folks were watching from the windows, everybody held their breath</p>
  <p>They knew this handsome ranger was about to meet his death</p>
  <p>About to meet his death</p>

  <p>There was 40 feet between them when they stopped to make their play</p>
  <p>And the swiftness of the ranger is still talked about today</p>
  <p>Texas Red had not cleared leather 'fore a bullet fairly ripped</p>
  <p>And the ranger's aim was deadly with the big iron on his hip</p>
  <p>Big iron on his hip</p>

  <p>It was over in a moment and the folks had gathered round</p>
  <p>There before them lay the body of the outlaw on the ground</p>
  <p>Oh, he might have went on living but he made one fatal slip</p>
  <p>When he tried to match the ranger with the big iron on his hip</p>
  <p>Big iron on his hip</p>
  <p>Big iron, big iron</p>
  <p>When he tried to match the ranger with the big iron on his hip</p>
  <p>Big iron on his hip</p>
