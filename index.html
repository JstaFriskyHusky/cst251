	<h1>BIG IRON</h1>
	<font size = +3>
	<p>To the town of Agua Fria, rode a stranger one fine day<br>
Hardly spoke to folks around him, didn't have too much to say<br>
No one dared to ask his business, no one dared to make a slip<br>
For the stranger there among 'em had a big iron on his hip<br>
Big iron on his hip<br>
It was early in the mornin' when he rode into town<br>
He came ridin' from the south side, slowly lookin' all around<br>
"He's an outlaw, loose and runnin'", came a whisper from each lip<br>
"He's here to do some business with the big iron on his hip<br>
Big iron on his hip"<br>
In this town there lived an outlaw by the name of Texas Red<br>
Many men had tried to take him and that many men were dead<br>
He was vicious and a killer, though a youth of twenty-four<br>
And the notches on his pistol numbered one and nineteen more<br>
One and nineteen more<br>
Now the stranger started talkin', made it plain to folks around<br>
Was an Arizonia ranger, wouldn't be too long in town<br>
He came there to take an outlaw back alive or maybe dead<br>
Said it didn't matter, he was after Texas Red, after Texas Red<br>
Wasn't long before this story was relayed to Texas Red<br>
But the outlaw didn't worry, men that tried before were dead<br>
Twenty men had tried to take him, twenty men had made a slip<br>
Twenty-one would be the ranger with the big iron on his hip<br>
Big iron on his hip<br>
The mornin' past so quickly, it was time for them to meet<br>
It was twenty past eleven when they walked out in the street<br>
Folks were watchin' from their windows, every body held their breath<br>
They knew this handsome ranger was about to meet his death<br>
About to meet his death<br>
There was forty feet between them when they stopped to make their play<br>
And the swiftness of the Ranger is still talked about today<br>
Texas Red had not cleared leather for a bullet fairly ripped<br>
And the ranger's aim was deadly, with the big iron on his hip<br>
Big iron on his hip<br>
It was over in a moment and the folks had gathered 'round<br>
There before them lay the body of the outlaw on the ground<br>
Oh, he might have gone on livin' but he made one fatal slip<br>
When he tried to match the ranger with the big iron on his hip<br>
Big iron on his hip<br>
Big iron, big iron<br>
When he tried to match the ranger with the big iron on his hip<br>
Big iron on his hip
