				<div class="stuff">
					<ol>
						<li>Had some problems with the aside tag text going out of border and off screen. I somehow fixed it but I have no clue how.
						I also had some problems with floating right, but this was due to having my position being absolute.</li>
							<li>Wasn't able to get my link to stay at the top with sticky. Was because my spelling was off like usual.</li>
