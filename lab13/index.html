		<h2>Problems I Had</h2>

				<div class="stuff">
					<ol>
						<li>Had some problems with the centering and the images as some worked and others didn't. The arrow was noticably very big despite changing the width and height of the png.</li>
							<li>I wasn't sure how the background graident worked, as it was going from bottom right to top left, but halfway through it becomes level.</li>
							<li> I was unable to find the exact colors for the background, so I chose the closest ones.</li>
